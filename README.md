# Time-Series-Forecasting

This projects presents pretty simple but effective models for time series forecasting consists of Linear and LSTM layers. Overall generally 2-layers Linear model shows better RMSE metric rather than LSTM and 2-LSTM layer model.
However, models introducesd in this project outperforms Linear and LSTM models:
1) The 2-LSTM model with Residual connection  outperforms LSTM and 2-LSTM layers models.
2) The sum of LSTM and Linear layers provides the best RMSE metrics abnd outperfors both Linear and LSTM models.
